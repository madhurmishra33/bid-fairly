# bid-fairly
A Blockchain running Smart Contract which provides fair biding functionality.

Solidity is being used to create Smart contract logic.
As smart contract works on Blockchain which provides far better immutablility then other technologies, hence provides a fair platform to run such contracts.

The above created contract exposes functions that help any particular user to create their own quiz or game with their result feeded and then other users can cast their answers and put their bid 
on their opted answer.
It gives functionality to the user to opt out from the game until its active and get back their bid, but as soon as the creater of game closes it, Winners are declared and bids are distributed evenly amongst the winners.
